# Bike Shop Project 
Bike Shop Application

This application is a console based application that demonstrates my skills in Object Oriented Programming using Python.  
This application is a basic application intended to be used by a bike shop to manage the rentals of different kinds of bikes.

Using the application: 
1. Run the 'FinalProject_TA.py' file in the environment of your choosing.

Other Important Notes:
1. This application uses the current time when a bike is rented and returned. Becuase of this, if you simply run the application it will not work properly because no substantial time has passed. To solve this, you will need to uncomment
'+ timedelta(days = 8, hours = 5)' on line 186 in order to add some time for the application to base the rental cost off of.
